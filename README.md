vim inspired music player written in rust (work in progress)
aims for fast navigation which i didnt find in most players

you are prompted to choose your source when first opening the program.
example: /home/kr24/Music

navigation:

: command mode
/ search mode
enter: track mode

fuzzy search allows you to quikcly find what you are looking for regardless of whether its an album, a track, an artist or a mix of anything since it uses the full paths

quit it like you would quit vim, 
navigate it like you would navigate vim
